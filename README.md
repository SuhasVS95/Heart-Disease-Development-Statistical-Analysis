# Problem Statement

In this fast moving world, one would almost forget to care about their health.

As per Centre for Disease Control in the USA,1 death every 36 seconds due to heart disease. (Refer:https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm#:~:text=Heart%20Disease%20in%20the%20United%20States&text=One%20person%20dies%20every%2036,1%20in%20every%204%20deaths)

It is very imperative to understand what lifestyle and health factors impact the development of the heart related problems.

Hence, in this study we use descriptive and Inferential statistical techniques to find possible relations among the lifestyle parameters and their contribution to the health of the heart.

# Dataset Information

The Framingham Heart Study is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of the city of Framingham, Massachusetts The study began in 1948, and is now on its fourth generation of participants.

# Tasks Completed:

1. Descriptive Statistical Analysis
2. Inferential Statistical Analysis

# Key Takeaways

## Descriptive Statistical Analysis:<br>

1) There is a strong corelation between systolic Blood Pressure and diastolic Blood Pressure.<br>

2) There is a weak Positive corelation between Age and BP,cholestrol.<br>

3) There is a negative corelation between age and cigarettes per day.<br>

4) Most of the people are middle aged i.e between 40 and 55 which constitutes 57.9% of the data.<br>

5) Most of the observations have Cholestrol level in the range 150-350 mg/dL and sysBP in the range 80-180 mmHg.<br>

6) We see there is an increase in BP as the person gets older.<br>

7) None of the numerical columns looks like normal except age. All others are either skewed or kurted.<br>

8) Except for age feature, outliers are present in all the other features.<br>

9) BMI has the least variance and the variable totChol has the maximum variance.<br>

10) Risk of developing heart disease increases with age.<br>


## Inferential Statistical Analysis:

1) Using Hypothesis testing, we have tested the claim normal glucose level has to be greater than 80 mg/dL.<br>

2) Variation of Z and T test parameters is almost equal for a large sample size.<br>

3) Understanding of Acception and Rejection region for the test conducted in the point 1.<br>

4) Tested the claim that the amount of cholestrol level is not same for both Male and Female.<br>

5) Tested wheter if proportion of age categories differ with people with diabetes/smoking habits/prevalentStroke/BPMeds/prevalentHyp<br>
